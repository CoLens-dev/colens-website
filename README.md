## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Tech Stack**

    - For our website we are using Gatsby and Github actions


2.  **Start developing**

    - It's really simple: clone the repo, make changes and create PR which will be reviewed and eventually your changes will be merged into main branch

3.  **CI/CD**

    - GitHub actions and github pages are used to build this website. Specific branch `gh-pages` is the source for github pages deployment. Action is triggered on every merge to `main` branch after which changes should be visible on https://colens.space soon enough.
